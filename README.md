### Grammar

#### Top-level:

- file has steps and playlists
- steps are the only thing run
- play runs a playlist

#### Steps:

- `play name nameB ... [N];`: run one or more playlists, optionally repeat N times.
- `delay x.y;`: set delay between steps to x.y seconds
- `sleep x.y;`: sleep for x.y seconds
- `shell "quoted strings"+;`: exec a command from the program

windows:

- `active someName;`: name the active window
- `focus someName;`: focus a named window

mouse:

- `mouse x y s;`: move the mouse to x,y in s seconds
- `click;`: click the left mouse button
- `btnclick [left,middle,right];`
- `btndown [left,middle,right];`
- `btnup [left,middle,right];`
- `draw [left,middle,right] x y s;`: drag the mouse to x,y in s seconds
- `scroll n;`: scroll n lines, negative is up
- `hscroll n;`: horizontal scroll n "clicks", negative is left

keyboard:

- `keypress "key";`
- `keydown "key";`
- `keyup "key";`
- `hotkeys "quoted" "keys" ...;`: press some keys together
- `write "quoted string\n";`: type a string, "\n" is enter

clipboard:

- `copy;`, just `ctrl-c`
- `paste;`, just `ctrl-v`
- `save_clipboard "name";` save the clipboard contents to "name"
- `load_clipboard "name";` load the clipboard contents from "name"
- `copy_clipboard "name";` copy && save the clipboard contents to "name"
- `paste_clipboard "name";` load the clipboard contents from "name" && paste

### Recording

You can record your mouse and keyboard
to a playlist file by:

```
sdd record.txt --record
```

_Note, not all keys are working yet._

A keymap to fix some is [here](./self_driving_desktop/keymap.py).

### Development Setup

```
virtualenv --python python3 penv
source penv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=.
python self_driving_desktop/__main__.py ...
```
